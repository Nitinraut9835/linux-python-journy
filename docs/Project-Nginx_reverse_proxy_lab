# Nginx Reverse Proxy Lab – Beginner DevOps Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of a Python backend server.

The goal of this project was to understand:

- Reverse proxy architecture
- HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500, 502)
- Log analysis
- Service troubleshooting
- Production-like failure simulation

---

## 🏗 Architecture

Client → Nginx (Port 80) → Python Backend (Port 5000)

- Nginx forwards incoming requests to the backend server
- Python backend handles application logic
- Logs are analyzed using Linux commands

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Nginx
- Python (built-in HTTP server)
- Linux
- systemctl
- journalctl
- grep, wc, tail
- curl

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

✔ Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy  
✔ Built a simple Python backend server  
✔ Generated different HTTP responses:
- 200 OK  
- 404 Not Found  
- 500 Internal Server Error  

✔ Simulated backend failure to produce:
- 502 Bad Gateway  

✔ Analyzed:
- /var/log/nginx/access.log
- /var/log/nginx/error.log

✔ Used journalctl for service troubleshooting  

---

## 🧪 Failure Simulation

When the backend server was stopped:

- Nginx returned **502 Bad Gateway**
- Error logs showed upstream connection failure
- Access logs recorded failed requests

This simulates a real production incident scenario.

## 📊 Log Analysis Examples

```bash
grep 404 /var/log/nginx/access.log
grep 500 /var/log/nginx/access.log
grep 502 /var/log/nginx/access.log
wc -l /var/log/nginx/access.log
